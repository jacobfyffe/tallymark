/**
 * ISRC enrichment.
 *
 * The recently-played feed gives us track IDs but no ISRC. ISRC is the primary
 * cross-service identity key (it's how the same recording is matched across
 * Spotify and Apple Music later), so we backfill it here from the full Track
 * objects returned by GET /v1/tracks/{id}.
 *
 * Why single-track calls instead of the batch endpoint: Spotify's Feb/Mar 2026
 * API migration made the batch endpoint (GET /v1/tracks?ids=...) return 403 for
 * Development Mode apps. The single-track endpoint still works, so we resolve
 * one track per request, capped per tick. Verified against this app's own data.
 *
 * This runs right after ingestion (and on quiet ticks, to chip away at any
 * backlog of plays that predate enrichment). It's deliberately tolerant: a
 * track that can't be resolved simply stays null and is retried later. The
 * caller (ingest) wraps this so a failure never disrupts already-stored plays.
